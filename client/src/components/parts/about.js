Satisfied with the education and development of their children, the parents of the students of 'Al Khansa'  asked Staff to prepare the continuity.

This is how the project of "Al Khansa" school was born.</p>
<p>
L'intégrale school is an educational complex that includes an elementary school and sports and cultural facilities. The school will serve the preparatory classes (5 years old) and the primary classes (from 6 to 11 years old) of the Ministry of Education. This program will be enriched in both French and English starting in the preparatory class.

This program corresponds to the French program for the following cycles: cycle 2 (GS - CP - CE1 - CE2) then cycle 3 (CM1 - CM2 - 6e).

L'Intégrale is a school that opened its doors in September 2016.</p><p>

Al Khansa School gives children the pleasure of learning, encourages them to grow and progress.</p><p>

At L'Intégrale, children learn the first skills that will help them develop their intellectual, cognitive and psychomotor capacities in a context where they will develop transversally their ability to appropriate the elements of the world around them and their capacity to develop systems of reasoning and communication within the educational community.

In order to do so, our school is equipped with a variety of spaces to welcome students in optimal conditions, anxious to respect the biological rhythms of the child and the specificities of each one.
